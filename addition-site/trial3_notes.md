#Notes from Trial 3 (10-28-15)
You forgot the *function() {* in `$(document).ready(function() {})`! Other than that, the code was fine.

You need to memorize the HTML and CSS styles a little better so that there's not so much time spent guessing-checking-editing. The code itself worked well, though.
